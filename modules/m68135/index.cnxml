<para id="fs-idm362180912">Both roommates make valid points about allocating limited resources. Ultimately, each must decide which method to use to allocate time, and they can make that decision based on their own analyses. Similarly, businesses and other organizations must create an allocation system for assigning limited resources, such as overhead. Whereas Kamil and Barry are discussing the allocation of hours, the issue of allocating costs raises similar questions. For example, for a manufacturer allocating maintenance costs, which are an overhead cost, is it better to allocate to each production department equally by the number of machines that need to be maintained or by the square footage of space that needs to be maintained?</para>
<para id="fs-idm365312512">In the past, overhead costs were typically allocated based on factors such as total direct labor hours, total direct labor costs, or total machine hours. This allocation process, often called the traditional allocation method, works most effectively when direct labor is a dominant component in production. However, many industries have evolved, primarily due to changes in technology, and their production processes have become more complicated, with more steps or components. Many of these industries have significantly reduced their use of direct labor and replaced it with technology, such as robotics or other machinery. For example, a mobile phone production facility in China replaced 90 percent of its workforce with robots.<footnote id="fs-idm362532384">June Javelosa and Kristin Houser. “This Company Replaced 90% of Its Workforce with Machines. Here’s What Happened.” <emphasis effect="italics">Futurism / World Economic Forum</emphasis>. https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/02/after-replacing-90-of-employees-with-robots-this-companys-productivity-soared</footnote></para>
<para id="fs-idm365376272">In these situations, a direct cost (labor) has been replaced by an overhead cost (e.g., depreciation on equipment). Because of this decrease in reliance on labor and/or changes in the types of production complexity and methods, the traditional method of overhead allocation becomes less effective in certain production environments. To account for these changes in technology and production, many organizations today have adopted an overhead allocation method known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">activity-based costing</term> (ABC). This chapter will explain the transition to ABC and provide a foundation in its mechanics.</para>
<para id="fs-idm359308224">Activity-based costing is an accounting method that recognizes the relationship between product costs and a production activity, such as the number of hours of engineering or design activity, the costs of the set up or preparation for the production of different products, or the costs of packaging different products after the production process is completed. Overhead costs are then allocated to production according to the use of that activity, such as the number of machine setups needed. In contrast, the traditional allocation method commonly uses cost drivers, such as direct labor or machine hours, as the single activity.</para>
<para id="fs-idm366756128">Because of the use of multiple activities as cost drivers, ABC costing has advantages over the traditional allocation method, which assigns overhead using a single predetermined overhead rate. Those advantages come at a cost, both in resources and time, since additional information needs to be collected and analyzed. <emphasis class="colored-text">Chrysler</emphasis>, for instance, shifted its overhead allocation to ABC in 1991 and estimates that the benefits of cost savings, product improvement, and elimination of inefficiencies have been ten to twenty times greater than the investment in the program at some sites. It believes other sites experienced savings of fifty to one hundred times the cost to implement the system.<footnote id="fs-idm374320144">Joseph H. Ness and Thomas G. Cucuzza. “Tapping the Full Potential of ABC.” <emphasis effect="italics">Harvard Business Review</emphasis>.

<para id="fs-idm378426768">As you’ve learned, understanding the cost needed to manufacture a product is critical to making many management decisions (<link target-id="OSX_Acct_M06_01_Components"/>). Knowing the total and component costs of the product is necessary for price setting and for measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization. Remember that product costs consist of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. It is relatively simple to understand each product’s direct material and direct labor cost, but it is more complicated to determine the overhead component of each product’s costs because there are a number of indirect and other costs to consider. A company’s <term id="term-00002">manufacturing overhead costs</term> are all costs other than direct material, direct labor, or selling and administrative costs. Once a company has determined the overhead, it must establish how to allocate the cost. This allocation can come in the form of the traditional overhead allocation method or activity-based costing..</para>

In order to perform the traditional method, it is also important to understand each of the involved cost components: direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Direct materials and direct labor are cost categories that are relatively easy to trace to a product. <term id="term-00004">Direct material</term> comprises the supplies used in manufacturing that can be traced directly to the product. <term id="term-00005">Direct labor</term> is the work used in manufacturing that can be directly traced to the product.

<title>Estimated Total Manufacturing Overhead Costs</title>
<para id="fs-idm379649904">The more challenging product component to track is manufacturing overhead. Overhead consists of indirect materials, indirect labor, and other costs closely associated with the manufacturing process but not tied to a specific product. Examples of other overhead costs include such items as depreciation on the factory machinery and insurance on the factory building. <term id="term-00006">Indirect material</term> comprises the supplies used in production that cannot be traced to an individual product, and <term id="term-00007">indirect labor</term> is the work done by employees not directly involved in the manufacturing process, such as the supervisors’ salaries or the maintenance staff’s wages. Because these costs cannot be traced directly to the product like direct costs are, they have to be allocated among all of the products produced and added, or applied, to the production and product cost.</para>
<para id="fs-idm381850976">For example, the recipe for shea butter has easily identifiable quantities of shea nuts and other ingredients. Based on the manufacturing process, it is also easy to determine the direct labor cost. But determining the exact overhead costs is not easy, as the cost of electricity needed to dry, crush, and roast the nuts changes depending on the moisture content of the nuts upon arrival.</para>
<para id="fs-idm375588464">Until now, you have learned to apply overhead to production based on a predetermined overhead rate typically using an activity base. An <term id="term-00008">activity base</term> is considered to be a primary driver of overhead costs, and traditionally, direct labor hours or machine hours were used for it. For example, a production facility that is fairly labor intensive would likely determine that the more labor hours worked, the higher the overhead will be. As a result, management would likely view labor hours as the activity base when applying overhead costs.</para>
<para id="fs-idm367147104">A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">predetermined overhead rate</term> is calculated at the start of the accounting period by dividing the estimated manufacturing overhead by the estimated activity base. The predetermined overhead rate is then applied to production to facilitate determining a standard cost for a product. This estimated overhead rate will allow a company to determine a cost for the product without having to wait, possibly several months, until all of the actual overhead costs are determined, and to help with issues such as seasonal production or variable overhead costs, such as utilities.</para>

<title>Calculation of Predetermined Overhead and Total Cost under Traditional Allocation</title>

<title>Computing Actual Overhead Costs</title>
<para id="fs-idm362204352">As manufacturing technology becomes less expensive and more efficient, the mix between overhead and labor changes so that tasks are more computerized tasks and involve less direct labor; the traditional use of direct labor hours or direct labor dollars changes accordingly. If the predetermined overhead rate is based on direct labor hours and set at the beginning of the year but manufacturing technology leads to a reduction in direct labor during the year, the number of direct labor hours may be less than estimated. This reduces the amount of overhead applied so that the overhead is more likely to be underapplied at the end of the year. Why do companies not wait until the end of the period and compute an actual overhead rate based on actual manufacturing costs and actual units?</para>
