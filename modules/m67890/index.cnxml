<para id="fs-idm338464752">As you’ve learned, the periodic inventory system is updated at the end of the period to adjust inventory numbers to match the physical count and provide accurate merchandise inventory values for the balance sheet. The adjustment ensures that only the inventory costs that remain on hand are recorded, and the remainder of the goods available for sale are expensed on the income statement as cost of goods sold. Here we will demonstrate the mechanics used to calculate the ending inventory values using the four cost allocation methods and the periodic inventory system.</para>

It is being marketed to parents of middle school and high school students as a safety measure. Parents benefit by being apprised of the child’s location, and the student benefits by not having to constantly check in with parents. Demand for the product has spiked during the current fiscal period, while supply is limited, causing the selling price to escalate rapidly. Note: For simplicity of demonstration, beginning inventory cost is assumed to be $21 per unit for all cost assumption methods.</para>

When perpetual methodology is utilized, the cost of goods sold and ending inventory are calculated at the time of each sale rather than at the end of the month. For example, in this case, when the first sale of 150 units is made, inventory will be removed and cost computed as of that date from the beginning inventory. The differences in timing as to when cost of goods sold is calculated can alter the order that costs are sequenced.</para>
