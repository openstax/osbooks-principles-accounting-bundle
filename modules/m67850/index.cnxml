<para id="fs-idm355355232">When a company reaches the end of a period, it must update certain accounts that have either been left unattended throughout the period or have not yet been recognized. <term>Adjusting entries</term> update accounting records at the end of a period for any transactions that have not yet been recorded. One important accounting principle to remember is that just as the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s equity/or common stock/or capital) must be equal, it must remain equal after you make adjusting entries. Also note that in this equation, owner’s equity represents an individual owner (sole proprietorship), common stock represents a corporation’s owners’ interests, and capital represents a partnership’s owners’ interests. We discuss the effects of adjusting entries in greater detail throughout this chapter.</para>
<para id="fs-idm628880496">There are several steps in the accounting cycle that require the preparation of a trial balance: step 4, preparing an unadjusted trial balance; step 6, preparing an adjusted trial balance; and step 9, preparing a post-closing trial balance. You might question the purpose of more than one trial balance. For example, why can we not go from the unadjusted trial balance straight into preparing financial statements for public consumption? What is the purpose of the adjusted trial balance? Does preparing more than one trial balance mean the company made a mistake earlier in the accounting cycle? To answer these questions, let’s first explore the (unadjusted) trial balance, and why some accounts have incorrect balances.</para>

<title>Why Some Accounts Have Incorrect Balances on the Trial Balance</title>
<para id="fs-idm362020256">The unadjusted trial balance may have incorrect balances in some accounts. Recall the <term class="no-emphasis">trial balance</term> from <link document="m67842">Analyzing and Recording Transactions</link> for the example company, Printing Plus.</para>

<para id="fs-idm372741440">The trial balance for Printing Plus shows Supplies of $500, which were purchased on January 30. Since this is a new company, Printing Plus would more than likely use some of their supplies right away, before the end of the month on January 31. Supplies are only an asset when they are unused. If Printing Plus used some of its supplies immediately on January 30, then why is the full $500 still in the supply account on January 31? How do we fix this incorrect balance?</para>
<para id="fs-idm320212160">Similarly, what about Unearned Revenue? On January 9, the company received $4,000 from a customer for printing services to be performed. The company recorded this as a liability because it received payment without providing the service. To clear this liability, the company must perform the service. Assume that as of January 31 some of the printing services have been provided. Is the full $4,000 still a liability? Since a portion of the service was provided, a change to unearned revenue should occur. The company needs to correct this balance in the Unearned Revenue account.</para>
<para id="fs-idm627294192">Having incorrect balances in Supplies and in Unearned Revenue on the company’s January 31 trial balance is not due to any error on the company’s part. The company followed all of the correct steps of the accounting cycle up to this point. So why are the balances still incorrect?</para>
<para id="fs-idm366043200">Journal entries are recorded when an activity or event occurs that triggers the entry. Usually the trigger is from an original source. Recall that an original source can be a formal document substantiating a transaction, such as an invoice, purchase order, cancelled check, or employee time sheet. Not every transaction produces an original source document that will alert the bookkeeper that it is time to make an entry.</para>
<para id="fs-idm627292768">When a company purchases supplies, the original order, receipt of the supplies, and receipt of the invoice from the vendor will all trigger journal entries. This trigger does not occur when using supplies from the supply closet. Similarly, for unearned revenue, when the company receives an advance payment from the customer for services yet provided, the cash received will trigger a journal entry. When the company provides the printing services for the customer, the customer will not send the company a reminder that revenue has now been earned. Situations such as these are why businesses need to make adjusting entries.</para>

<para id="fs-idm361994256">One difference is the supplies account; the figure on paper does not match the value of the supplies inventory still available. Another difference was interest earned from his bank account. He did not have anything recognizing these earnings.</para>
<para id="fs-idm370675776">Why did his unadjusted trial balance have these errors? What can be attributed to the differences in supply figures? What can be attributed to the differences in interest earned?</para>

<title>The Need for Adjusting Entries</title>
<para id="fs-idm364751280">Adjusting entries update accounting records at the end of a period for any transactions that have not yet been recorded. These entries are necessary to ensure the income statement and balance sheet present the correct, up-to-date numbers. Adjusting entries are also necessary because the initial trial balance may not contain complete and current data due to several factors:</para>
<list id="fs-idm317862608" list-type="bulleted">
<item>The inefficiency of recording every single day-to-day event, such as the use of supplies.</item>
<item>Some costs are not recorded during the period but must be recognized at the end of the period, such as depreciation, rent, and insurance.</item>
<item>Some items are forthcoming for which original source documents have not yet been received, such as a utility bill.</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm317860656">There are a few other guidelines that support the need for adjusting entries.</para>
<section id="fs-idm317860272">
<title>Guidelines Supporting Adjusting Entries</title>
<para id="fs-idm630912416">Several guidelines support the need for adjusting entries:</para>
<list id="fs-idm363783712" list-type="bulleted">
<item>Revenue recognition principle: Adjusting entries are necessary because the revenue recognition principle requires revenue recognition when earned, thus the need for an update to unearned revenues.</item>
<item>Expense recognition (matching) principle: This requires matching expenses incurred to generate the revenues earned, which affects accounts such as insurance expense and supplies expense.</item>
<item>Time period assumption: This requires useful information be presented in shorter time periods such as years, quarters, or months. This means a company must recognize revenues and expenses in the proper period, requiring adjustment to certain accounts to meet these criteria.</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm342958352">The required adjusting entries depend on what types of transactions the company has, but there are some common types of adjusting entries. Before we look at recording and posting the most common types of adjusting entries, we briefly discuss the various types of adjusting entries.</para>
</section>

<section id="fs-idm306394912">
<title>Types of Adjusting Entries</title>
<para id="fs-idm631782576">Adjusting entries requires updates to specific account types at the end of the period. Not all accounts require updates, only those not naturally triggered by an original source document. There are two main types of adjusting entries that we explore further, deferrals and accruals.</para>
</section>
<section id="fs-idm623437088">
<title>Deferrals</title>
<para id="fs-idm623436448"><term>Deferrals</term> are prepaid expense and revenue accounts that have delayed recognition until they have been used or earned. This recognition may not occur until the end of a period or future periods. When deferred expenses and revenues have yet to be recognized, their information is stored on the balance sheet. As soon as the expense is incurred and the revenue is earned, the information is transferred from the balance sheet to the income statement. Two main types of deferrals are prepaid expenses and unearned revenues.</para>
<section id="fs-idm623435280">
<title>Prepaid Expenses</title>
<para id="fs-idm623434640">Recall from <link document="m67842">Analyzing and Recording Transactions</link> that <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">prepaid expenses</emphasis></term> (prepayments) are assets for which advanced payment has occurred, before the company can benefit from use. As soon as the asset has provided benefit to the company, the value of the asset used is transferred from the balance sheet to the income statement as an expense. Some common examples of prepaid expenses are supplies, depreciation, insurance, and rent.</para>
<para id="fs-idm365564320">When a company purchases supplies, it may not use all supplies immediately, but chances are the company has used some of the supplies by the end of the period. It is not worth it to record every time someone uses a pencil or piece of paper during the period, so at the end of the period, this account needs to be updated for the value of what has been used.</para>
<para id="fs-idm365563568">Let’s say a company paid for supplies with cash in the amount of $400. At the end of the month, the company took an inventory of supplies used and determined the value of those supplies used during the period to be $150. The following entry occurs for the initial payment.</para>
<media id="fs-idm615684592" alt="Journal entry, undated. Debit Supplies 400. Credit Cash 400. Explanation: “To recognize purchase of supplies.”">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/OSX_Acct_F04_02_Jorn01_img.jpg"/>
</media>
<para id="fs-idm370664160">Supplies increases (debit) for $400, and Cash decreases (credit) for $400. When the company recognizes the supplies usage, the following adjusting entry occurs.</para>
<media id="fs-idm314870656" alt="Journal entry, undated. Debit Supplies Expense 150. Credit Supplies 150. Explanation: “To recognize supplies used during the period.”">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/OSX_Acct_F04_02_Jorn02_img.jpg"/>
</media>
<para id="fs-idm365550064">Supplies Expense is an expense account, increasing (debit) for $150, and Supplies is an asset account, decreasing (credit) for $150. This means $150 is transferred from the balance sheet (asset) to the income statement (expense). Notice that not all of the supplies are used. There is still a balance of $250 (400 – 150) in the Supplies account. This amount will carry over to future periods until used. The balances in the Supplies and Supplies Expense accounts show as follows.</para>
<media id="fs-idm355840544" class="scaled-down" alt="Two T-accounts. Left T-account labeled Supplies; debit entry 400; credit entry 150; debit balance 250. Right T-account labeled Supplies Expense; debit entry 150; debit balance 150.">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/OSX_Acct_F04_02_TAcct01_img.jpg"/>
</media>
<para id="fs-idm368120768">Depreciation may also require an adjustment at the end of the period. Recall that <emphasis effect="italics">depreciation</emphasis> is the systematic method to record the allocation of cost over a given period of certain assets. This allocation of cost is recorded over the <term>useful life</term> of the asset, or the time period over which an asset cost is allocated. The allocated cost up to that point is recorded in Accumulated Depreciation, a contra asset account. A <term>contra account</term> is an account paired with another account type, has an opposite normal balance to the paired account, and reduces the balance in the paired account at the end of a period.</para>
<para id="fs-idm368215056">Accumulated Depreciation is contrary to an asset account, such as Equipment. This means that the normal balance for Accumulated Depreciation is on the credit side. It houses all depreciation expensed in current and prior periods. Accumulated Depreciation will reduce the asset account for depreciation incurred up to that point. The difference between the asset’s value (cost) and accumulated depreciation is called the <term>book value</term> of the asset. When depreciation is recorded in an adjusting entry, Accumulated Depreciation is credited and Depreciation Expense is debited.</para>
<para id="fs-idm324196064">For example, let’s say a company pays $2,000 for equipment that is supposed to last four years. The company wants to depreciate the asset over those four years equally. This means the asset will lose $500 in value each year ($2,000/four years). In the first year, the company would record the following adjusting entry to show depreciation of the equipment.</para>
<media id="fs-idm631208096" class="scaled-down" alt="Journal entry, undated. Debit Depreciation Expense 500. Credit Accumulated Depreciation Equipment 500. Explanation: “To recognize depreciation for the year.”">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/OSX_Acct_F04_02_Jorn03_img.jpg"/>
</media>
<para id="fs-idm308991552">Depreciation Expense increases (debit) and Accumulated Depreciation, Equipment, increases (credit). If the company wanted to compute the book value, it would take the original cost of the equipment and subtract accumulated depreciation.</para>
<equation id="fs-idm624288816" class="unnumbered"><m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>Book value of equipment</m:mtext><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>$2,000</m:mn><m:mo>–</m:mo><m:mn>$500</m:mn><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>$1,500</m:mn></m:mrow></m:math></equation>
<para id="fs-idm315961440">This means that the current book value of the equipment is $1,500, and depreciation will be subtracted from this figure the next year. The following account balances after adjustment are as follows:</para>
<media id="fs-idm319409616" alt="Two T-accounts. Left T-account labeled Accumulated Depreciation: Equipment; credit entry 500; credit balance 500. Right T-account labeled Depreciation Expense; debit entry 500, debit balance 500.">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/OSX_Acct_F04_02_TAcct02_img.jpg"/>
</media>
<para id="fs-idm641188528">You will learn more about depreciation and its computation in <link document="m67894">Long-Term Assets</link>. However, one important fact that we need to address now is that the book value of an asset is not necessarily the price at which the asset would sell. For example, you might have a building for which you paid $1,000,000 that currently has been depreciated to a book value of $800,000. However, today it could sell for more than, less than, or the same as its book value. The same is true about just about any asset you can name, except, perhaps, cash itself.</para>
<para id="fs-idm615657280">Insurance policies can require advanced payment of fees for several months at a time, six months, for example. The company does not use all six months of insurance immediately but over the course of the six months. At the end of each month, the company needs to record the amount of insurance expired during that month.</para>
<para id="fs-idm615656560">For example, a company pays $4,500 for an insurance policy covering six months. It is the end of the first month and the company needs to record an adjusting entry to recognize the insurance used during the month. The following entries show the initial payment for the policy and the subsequent adjusting entry for one month of insurance usage.</para>
<media id="fs-idm629012736" alt="Journal with two undated entries. First entry: debit Prepaid Insurance 4,500; Credit Cash 4,500.

<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/OSX_Acct_F04_02_Jorn04_img.jpg"/>
</media>
<para id="fs-idm355409136">In the first entry, Cash decreases (credit) and Prepaid Insurance increases (debit) for $4,500. In the second entry, Prepaid Insurance decreases (credit) and Insurance Expense increases (debit) for one month’s insurance usage found by taking the total $4,500 and dividing by six months (4,500/6 = 750). The account balances after adjustment are as follows:</para>
<media id="fs-idm306444368" class="scaled-down" alt="Two T-accounts. Left T-account labeled Prepaid Insurance; debit entry 4,500; credit entry 750; debit balance 3,750. Right T-account labeled Insurance Expense; debit entry 750; debit balance 750.">

</media>
<para id="fs-idm632348272">Similar to prepaid insurance, rent also requires advanced payment. Usually to rent a space, a company will need to pay rent at the beginning of the month. The company may also enter into a lease agreement that requires several months, or years, of rent in advance. Each month that passes, the company needs to record rent used for the month.</para>
<para id="fs-idm615654896">Let’s say a company pays $8,000 in advance for four months of rent. After the first month, the company records an adjusting entry for the rent used. The following entries show initial payment for four months of rent and the adjusting entry for one month’s usage.</para>
<media id="fs-idm314733680" alt="Journal with two undated entries. First entry: debit Prepaid Rent 8,000; credit Cash 8,000.

<para id="fs-idm364933328">Another type of deferral requiring adjustment is unearned revenue.</para>
</section>
<section id="fs-idm324501488">
<title>Unearned Revenues</title>
<para id="fs-idm357022496">Recall that <term class="no-emphasis">unearned revenue</term> represents a customer’s advanced payment for a product or service that has yet to be provided by the company. Since the company has not yet provided the product or service, it cannot recognize the customer’s payment as revenue. At the end of a period, the company will review the account to see if any of the unearned revenue has been earned. If so, this amount will be recorded as revenue in the current period.</para>
<para id="fs-idm314647296">For example, let’s say the company is a law firm. During the year, it collected retainer fees totaling $48,000 from clients. Retainer fees are money lawyers collect in advance of starting work on a case. When the company collects this money from its clients, it will debit cash and credit unearned fees. Even though not all of the $48,000 was probably collected on the same day, we record it as if it was for simplicity’s sake.</para>
<media id="fs-idm368402992" alt="Journal entry, undated. Debit Cash 48,000. Credit Unearned Fee Revenue 48,000. Explanation: “To recognize collection of retainer fees.”">

</section>
<section id="fs-idm343488528">
<title>Accruals</title>
<para id="fs-idm631582160"><term>Accruals</term> are types of adjusting entries that accumulate during a period, where amounts were previously unrecorded. The two specific types of adjustments are accrued revenues and accrued expenses.</para>
<section id="fs-idm630909408">
<title>Accrued Revenues</title>
<para id="fs-idm372922272"><term>Accrued revenues</term> are revenues earned in a period but have yet to be recorded, and no money has been collected. Some examples include interest, and services completed but a bill has yet to be sent to the customer.</para>
<para id="fs-idm315474416">Interest can be earned from bank account holdings, notes receivable, and some accounts receivables (depending on the contract). Interest had been accumulating during the period and needs to be adjusted to reflect interest earned at the end of the period. Note that this interest has not been paid at the end of the period, only earned. This aligns with the revenue recognition principle to recognize revenue when earned, even if cash has yet to be collected.</para>
<para id="fs-idm366179552">For example, assume that a company has one outstanding note receivable in the amount of $100,000. Interest on this note is 5% per year.

<para id="fs-idm358930496">Previously unrecorded service revenue can arise when a company provides a service but did not yet bill the client for the work.

<para id="fs-idm315977744">For example, a company performs landscaping services in the amount of $1,500. However, they have not yet received payment. At the period end, the company would record the following adjusting entry.</para>

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<list id="fs-idm361429264" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>Incorrect balances: Incorrect balances on the unadjusted trial balance occur because not every transaction produces an original source document that will alert the bookkeeper it is time to make an entry. It is not that the accountant made an error, it means an adjustment is required to correct the balance.</item>
<item>Need for adjustments: Some account adjustments are needed to update records that may not have original source documents or those that do not reflect change on a daily basis. The revenue recognition principle, expense recognition principle, and time period assumption all further the need for adjusting entries because they require revenue and expense reporting occur when earned and incurred in a current period.</item>
<item>Prepaid expenses: Prepaid expenses are assets paid for before their use. When they are used, this asset’s value is reduced and an expense is recognized. Some examples include supplies, insurance, and depreciation.</item>
<item>Unearned revenues: These are customer advanced payments for product or services yet to be provided. When the company provides the product or service, revenue is then recognized.</item>
<item>Accrued revenues: Accrued revenues are revenues earned in a period but have yet to be recorded and no money has been collected. Accrued revenues are updated at the end of the period to recognize revenue and money owed to the company.</item>
<item>Accrued expenses: Accrued expenses are incurred in a period but have yet to be recorded and no money has been paid. Accrued expenses are updated to reflect the expense and the company’s liability.</item>
