<para id="fs-idm194354032">Sometimes, a business will need to use cost estimation techniques, particularly in the case of mixed costs, so that they can separate the fixed and variable components, since only the variable components change in the short run. Estimation is also useful for using current data to predict the effects of future changes in production on total costs. Three estimation techniques that can be used include the scatter graph, the high-low method, and regression analysis. Here we will demonstrate the scatter graph and the high-low methods (you will learn the regression analysis technique in advanced managerial accounting courses.</para>

<title>Functions of Cost Equations</title>
<para id="fs-idm203283760">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">cost equation</term> is a linear equation that takes into consideration total fixed costs, the fixed component of mixed costs, and variable cost per unit. Cost equations can use past data to determine patterns of past costs that can then project future costs, or they can use estimated or expected future data to estimate future costs. Recall the mixed cost equation:</para>

<title>Demonstration of the Scatter Graph Method to Calculate Future Costs at Varying Activity Levels</title>
<para id="fs-idm207335632">One of the assumptions that managers must make in order to use the cost equation is that the relationship between activity and costs is linear. In other words, costs rise in direct proportion to activity. A diagnostic tool that is used to verify this assumption is a scatter graph.</para>
<para id="fs-idm194250416">A <term id="term-00002">scatter graph</term> shows plots of points that represent actual costs incurred for various levels of activity. Once the scatter graph is constructed, we draw a line (often referred to as a <emphasis effect="italics">trend line</emphasis>) that appears to best fit the pattern of dots. Because the trend line is somewhat subjective, the scatter graph is often used as a preliminary tool to explore the possibility that the relationship between cost and activity is generally a linear relationship. When interpreting a scatter graph, it is important to remember that different people would likely draw different lines, which would lead to different estimations of fixed and variable costs. No one person’s line and cost estimates would necessarily be right or wrong compared to another; they would just be different. After using a scatter graph to determine whether cost and activity have a linear relationship, managers often move on to more precise processes for cost estimation, such as the high-low method or least-squares regression analysis.</para>
<para id="fs-idm197451824">To demonstrate how a company would use a scatter graph, let’s turn to the data for Regent Airlines, which operates a fleet of regional jets serving the northeast United States. The Federal Aviation Administration establishes guidelines for routine aircraft maintenance based upon the number of flight hours. As a result, Regent finds that its maintenance costs vary from month to month with the number of flight hours, as depicted in <link target-id="OSX_Acct_M02_03_RAir01"/>.</para>

<para id="fs-idm196897408">In scatter graphs, cost is considered the dependent variable because cost <emphasis effect="italics">depends</emphasis> upon the level of activity. The activity is considered the independent variable since it is the cause of the variation in costs. Regent’s scatter graph shows a positive relationship between flight hours and maintenance costs because, as flight hours increase, maintenance costs also increase. This is referred to as a positive linear relationship or a linear cost behavior.</para>

<para id="fs-idm212737888">As you can see from the scatter graph, there is really not a linear relationship between how many flight hours are flown and the costs of snow removal. This makes sense as snow removal costs are linked to the amount of snow and the number of flights taking off and landing but not to how many hours the planes fly.</para>
<para id="fs-idm197413856">Using a scatter graph to determine if this linear relationship exists is an essential first step in cost behavior analysis. If the scatter graph reveals a linear cost behavior, then managers can proceed with a more sophisticated analyses to separate mixed costs into their fixed and variable components. However, if this linear relationship is not present, then other methods of analysis are not appropriate. Let’s examine the cost data from Regent Airline using the high-low method.</para>

<title>Demonstration of the High-Low Method to Calculate Future Costs at Varying Activity Levels</title>
<para id="fs-idm202518880">As you’ve learned, the purpose of identifying costs is to control them, and managers regularly use past costs to predict future costs. Since we know that variable costs change with the level of activity, we can conclude that there is <emphasis effect="italics">usually</emphasis> a positive relationship between cost and activity: As one rises, so does the other. Ideally, this can be confirmed on a scatter graph. One of the simplest ways to analyze costs is to use the <term id="term-00003">high-low method</term>, a technique for separating the fixed and variable cost components of mixed costs. Using the highest and lowest levels of activity and their associated costs, we are able to estimate the variable cost components of mixed costs.</para>
<para id="fs-idm195393600">Once we have established that there is linear cost behavior, we can equate variable costs with the slope of the line, expressed as the rise of the line over the run. The steeper the slope of the line, the faster costs rise in response to a change in activity. Recall from the scatter graph that costs are the dependent <emphasis effect="italics">Y</emphasis> variable and activity is the independent <emphasis effect="italics">X</emphasis> variable. By examining the change in <emphasis effect="italics">Y</emphasis> relative to the change in <emphasis effect="italics">X</emphasis>, we can predict cost:</para>
<media id="fs-idm194257232" class="scaled-down" alt="Variable cost equals rise of the line divided by run of the line, equals Y subscript 2 minus Y subscript 1 divided by X subscript 2 minus X subscript 1.">

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm222192256">Although managers frequently use this method, it is not the most accurate approach to predicting future costs because it is based on only two pieces of cost data: the highest and the lowest levels of activity. Actual costs can vary significantly from these estimates, especially when the high or low activity levels are not representative of the usual level of activity within the business. For a more accurate model, the least-squares regression method would be used to separate mixed costs into their fixed and variable components. The least-squares regression method is a statistical technique that may be used to estimate the total cost at the given level of activity based on past cost data. Least-squares regression minimizes the errors of trying to fit a line between the data points and thus fits the line more closely to all the data points.</para>

You will learn more about these various labels and how they are applied in decision-making processes as you continue your study of managerial accounting in this course.</para>

What is the variable cost per mile if Able Transport uses the high-low method to analyze costs?</para>
