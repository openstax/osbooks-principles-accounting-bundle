<title>Should You Compromise to Please Your Supervisor?</title>
<para id="fs-idm517643488">You are an accountant for a small event-planning business. The business has been operating for several years but does not have the resources for accounting software. This means you are preparing all steps in the accounting cycle by hand.</para>

<title>Introduction to the Closing Entries</title>
<para id="fs-idm500371984">Companies are required to close their books at the end of each fiscal year so that they can prepare their annual financial statements and tax returns. However, most companies prepare monthly financial statements and close their books annually, so they have a clear picture of company performance during the year, and give users timely information to make decisions.</para>
<para id="fs-idm474463264"><term id="term-00002">Closing entries</term> prepare a company for the next accounting period by clearing any outstanding balances in certain accounts that should not transfer over to the next period. <term id="term-00003">Closing</term>, or clearing the balances, means returning the account to a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">zero balance</term>. Having a zero balance in these accounts is important so a company can compare performance across periods, particularly with income. It also helps the company keep thorough records of account balances affecting retained earnings. Revenue, expense, and dividend accounts affect retained earnings and are closed so they can accumulate new balances in the next period, which is an application of the time period assumption.</para>
<para id="fs-idm204008128">To further clarify this concept, balances are closed to assure all revenues and expenses are recorded in the proper period and then start over the following period. The revenue and expense accounts should start at zero each period, because we are measuring how much revenue is earned and expenses incurred during the period. However, the cash balances, as well as the other balance sheet accounts, are carried over from the end of a current period to the beginning of the next period.</para>
<para id="fs-idm186479232">For example, a store has an inventory account balance of $100,000. If the store closed at 11:59 p.m. on January 31, 2019, then the inventory balance when it reopened at 12:01 a.m. on February 1, 2019, would still be $100,000. The balance sheet accounts, such as inventory, would carry over into the next period, in this case February 2019.</para>
<para id="fs-idm197100256">The accounts that need to start with a clean or $0 balance going into the next accounting period are revenue, income, and any dividends from January 2019. To determine the income (profit or loss) from the month of January, the store needs to close the income statement information from January 2019. Zeroing January 2019 would then enable the store to calculate the income (profit or loss) for the next month (February 2019), instead of merging it into January’s income and thus providing invalid information solely for the month of February.</para>
<para id="fs-idm208496496">However, if the company also wanted to keep year-to-date information from month to month, a separate set of records could be kept as the company progresses through the remaining months in the year. For our purposes, assume that we are closing the books at the end of each month unless otherwise noted.</para>
<para id="fs-idm193601680">Let’s look at another example to illustrate the point. Assume you own a small landscaping business. It is the end of the year, December 31, 2018, and you are reviewing your financials for the entire year. You see that you earned $120,000 this year in revenue and had expenses for rent, electricity, cable, internet, gas, and food that totaled $70,000.</para>
<para id="fs-idm187726832">You also review the following information:</para>
<media id="fs-idm193271360" class="scaled-down" alt="Value December 31: Bank account balance $7,500, Electronics 3,250, Car 26,545, Furniture 7,200, Credit card balances 9,270, Bank loans 48,350.">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/OSX_Acct_F05_01_AssetLiab_img.jpg"/>
</media>
<para id="fs-idm226120304">The next day, January 1, 2019, you get ready for work, but before you go to the office, you decide to review your financials for 2019. What are your year-to-date earnings? So far, you have not worked at all in the current year. What are your total expenses for rent, electricity, cable and internet, gas, and food for the current year? You have also not incurred any expenses yet for rent, electricity, cable, internet, gas or food. This means that the current balance of these accounts is zero, because they were closed on December 31, 2018, to complete the annual accounting period.</para>
<para id="fs-idm209856352">Next, you review your assets and liabilities. What is your current bank account balance? What is the current book value of your electronics, car, and furniture? What about your credit card balances and bank loans? Are the value of your assets and liabilities now zero because of the start of a new year? Your car, electronics, and furniture did not suddenly lose all their value, and unfortunately, you still have outstanding debt. Therefore, these accounts still have a balance in the new year, because they are not closed, and the balances are carried forward from December 31 to January 1 to start the new annual accounting period.</para>
<para id="fs-idm743358672">This is no different from what will happen to a company at the end of an accounting period. A company will see its revenue and expense accounts set back to zero, but its assets and liabilities will maintain a balance. Stockholders’ equity accounts will also maintain their balances. In summary, the accountant resets the temporary accounts to zero by transferring the balances to permanent accounts.</para>

<para id="fs-idm518918832">Understanding the accounting cycle and preparing trial balances is a practice valued internationally.

<title>Temporary and Permanent Accounts</title>
<para id="fs-idm479838496">All accounts can be classified as either permanent (real) or temporary (nominal) (<link target-id="OSX_Acct_F05_01_Accounts"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-idm763716624"><term id="term-00005">Permanent (real) accounts</term> are accounts that transfer balances to the next period and include balance sheet accounts, such as assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity. These accounts will not be set back to zero at the beginning of the next period; they will keep their balances. Permanent accounts are not part of the closing process.</para>
<para id="fs-idm762008224"><term id="term-00006">Temporary (nominal) accounts</term> are accounts that are closed at the end of each accounting period, and include income statement, dividends, and income summary accounts. The new account, Income Summary, will be discussed shortly. These accounts are temporary because they keep their balances during the current accounting period and are set back to zero when the period ends. Revenue and expense accounts are closed to Income Summary, and Income Summary and Dividends are closed to the permanent account, Retained Earnings.</para>

<para id="fs-idm466102720">The <term id="term-00007">income summary</term> account is an intermediary between revenues and expenses, and the Retained Earnings account. It stores all of the closing information for revenues and expenses, resulting in a “summary” of income or loss for the period. The balance in the Income Summary account equals the net income or loss for the period. This balance is then transferred to the Retained Earnings account.</para>
<para id="fs-idm202887408">Income summary is an undefined account category. This means that it is not an asset, liability, stockholders’ equity, revenue, or expense account. The account has a zero balance throughout the entire accounting period until the closing entries are prepared. Therefore, it will not appear on any trial balances, including the adjusted trial balance, and will not appear on any of the financial statements.</para>
<para id="fs-idm211109696">You might be asking yourself, “is the Income Summary account even necessary?” Could we just close out revenues and expenses directly into retained earnings and not have this extra temporary account? We could do this, but by having the Income Summary account, you get a balance for net income a second time. This gives you the balance to compare to the income statement, and allows you to double check that all income statement accounts are closed and have correct amounts. If you put the revenues and expenses directly into retained earnings, you will not see that check figure. No matter which way you choose to close, the same final balance is in retained earnings.</para>

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<list id="fs-idm232645648" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>Closing entries: Closing entries prepare a company for the next period and zero out balance in temporary accounts.</item>
<item>Purpose of closing entries: Closing entries are necessary because they help a company review income accumulation during a period, and verify data figures found on the adjusted trial balance.</item>
<item>Permanent accounts: Permanent accounts do not close and are accounts that transfer balances to the next period. They include balance sheet accounts, such as assets, liabilities, and stockholder’s equity</item>
<item>Temporary accounts: Temporary accounts are closed at the end of each accounting period and include income statement, dividends, and income summary accounts.</item>
<item>Income Summary: The Income Summary account is an intermediary between revenues and expenses, and the Retained Earnings account. It stores all the closing information for revenues and expenses, resulting in a “summary” of income or loss for the period.</item>
<item>Recording closing entries: There are four closing entries; closing revenues to income summary, closing expenses to income summary, closing income summary to retained earnings, and close dividends to retained earnings.</item>
<item>Posting closing entries: Once all closing entries are complete, the information is transferred to the general ledger T-accounts. Balances in temporary accounts will show a zero balance.</item>
