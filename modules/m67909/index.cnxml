<para id="fs-idm312976912">Have you ever looked at your paycheck and wondered where all the money went? Well, it did not disappear; the money was used to contribute required and optional financial payments to various entities.</para>
<para id="fs-idm294995280">Payroll can be one of the largest expenses and potential liabilities for a business. Payroll liabilities include employee salaries and wages, and deductions for taxes, benefits, and employer contributions. In this section, we explain these elements of payroll and the required journal entries.</para>

<title>Employee Compensation and Deductions</title>
<para id="fs-idm315640912">As an employee working in a business, you receive compensation for your work. This pay could be a monthly salary or hourly wages paid periodically. The amount earned by the employee before any reductions in pay occur is considered <term id="term-00001">gross income (pay)</term>. These reductions include involuntary and voluntary deductions. The remaining balance after deductions is considered <term id="term-00002">net income (pay)</term>, or “take-home-pay.” The take-home-pay is what employees receive and deposit in their bank accounts.</para>

<title>Involuntary Deductions</title>
<para id="fs-idm312858688"><term id="term-00003">Involuntary deductions</term> are withholdings that neither the employer nor the employee have control over and are required by law.</para>
<para id="fs-idm312681808">Federal, state, and local income taxes are considered involuntary deductions. Income taxes imposed are different for every employee and are based on their W-4 Form, the Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate. An employee will fill in his or her marital status, number of allowances requested, and any additional reduction amounts. The employer will use this information to determine the <term id="term-00004">federal income tax withholding</term> amount from each paycheck. <term id="term-00005">State income tax withholding</term> may also use W-4 information or the state’s withholdings certificate. The federal income tax withholding and state income tax withholding amounts can be established with tax tables published annually by the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Internal Revenue Service</term> (IRS) (see <link target-id="OSX_Acct_F12_05_TaxTable"/>) and state government offices, respectively. Some states though do not require an income tax withholding, since they do not impose a state income tax. Federal and state income liabilities are held in payable accounts until disbursement to the governmental bodies that administer the tax compliance process for their particular governmental entity.</para>

If local income taxes are withheld, these remain current liabilities until paid.</para>
<para id="fs-idm307986976">Other involuntary deductions involve <term id="term-00008">Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) taxes</term> for Social Security and Medicare. FICA mandates employers to withhold taxes from employee wages “to provide benefits for retirees, the disabled, and children.” The <term id="term-00009">Social Security tax rate</term> is 6.2% of employee gross wages. As of 2017, there is a maximum taxable earnings amount of $127,200. Meaning, only the first $127,200 of each employee’s gross wages has the Social Security tax applied. In 2018, the maximum taxable earnings amount increased to $128,400. The <term id="term-00010">Medicare tax rate</term> is 1.45% of employee gross income. There is no taxable earnings cap for Medicare tax. The two taxes combined equal 7.65% (6.2% + 1.45%). Both the employer and the employee pay the two taxes on behalf of the employee.</para>
<para id="fs-idm337849376">More recent health-care legislation, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), requires an <term id="term-00011">additional medicare tax</term> withholding from employee pay of 0.9% for individuals who exceed an income threshold based on their filing status (married, single, or head of household, for example).

<section id="fs-idm314421456">
<title>Voluntary Deductions</title>
<para id="fs-idm309343120">In addition to involuntary deductions, employers may withhold certain <term id="term-00012">voluntary deductions</term> from employee wages. Voluntary deductions are not required to be removed from employee pay unless the employee designates reduction of these amounts. Voluntary deductions may include, but are not limited to, health-care coverage, life insurance, retirement contributions, charitable contributions, pension funds, and union dues. Employees can cover the full cost of these benefits or they may cost-share with the employer.</para>
<para id="fs-idm327372048">Health-care coverage is a requirement for many businesses to provide as a result of the ACA. Employers may provide partial benefit coverage and request the employee to pay the remainder. For example, the employer would cover 30% of health-care cost, and 70% would be the employee’s responsibility.</para>
<para id="fs-idm315703968">Retirement contributions may include those made to an employer-sponsored plan, such as a <term id="term-00013">defined contribution plan</term>, which “shelters” the income in a 401(k) or a 403(b). In simple terms, a defined contribution plan allows an employee to voluntarily contribute a specified amount or percentage of his or her pretax wages to a special account in order to defer the tax on those earnings. Usually, a portion of the employee’s contribution is matched by his or her employer; employers often use this as an incentive to attract and keep highly skilled and valuable employees. Only when the employee eventually withdraws funds from the plan will he or she be required to pay the tax on those earnings. Because the amount contributed to the plan is not immediately taxed by the IRS, it enables the employee to accumulate funds for his or her retirement. This deferred income may be excluded from the employee’s current federal taxable income but not FICA taxes. All voluntary deductions are considered employer liabilities until remitted. For more in-depth information on retirement planning, and using a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">401(k)</term> or a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">403(b)</term>, refer to <link document="m71404">Appendix C</link>.</para>

<title>Should You Start Saving for Retirement?</title>
<para id="fs-idm292503936">Should you save for retirement now or wait? As a student, you may be inclined to put off saving for retirement for many reasons. You may not be in a financial position to do so, you believe Social Security will be enough to cover your needs, or you may not have even thought about it up to this point.</para>
<para id="fs-idm353179984">According to a 2012 survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, of those who had access to a defined contribution plan, only 68% of employees contributed to their retirement plan. Many employees wait until their mid-thirties or forties to begin saving, and this can delay retirement, or may leave the retiree unable to cover his or her annual expenses. Some pitfalls contributing to this lack of saving are short-term negative spending practices such as high-interest loan debt, credit card purchases, and discretionary spending (optional expenses such as eating out or entertainment). To avoid these hazards, you should</para>
<list id="fs-idm341696944" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
<item>Analyze your spending habits and make changes where possible.</item>
<item>Develop a financial plan with the help of a finance specialist.</item>
<item>Join a defined contribution plan and stick with the plan (do not withdraw funds early).</item>
<item>Try to contribute at least as much as your employer is willing to match.</item>
<item>Consider other short-term savings options like bonds, or high-interest bank accounts.</item>
<item>Have a specific savings goal for your retirement account. For example, many financial advisors recommend saving at least 15% of your monthly income for retirement. However, they usually include both the employee’s contribution and the employer’s. For example, assume that the company matches each dollar invested by the employee with a $0.50 contribution from the employer, up to 8% for the employee. In this case, if the employee contributes 8% and the company provides 4%, that takes the employee to 80% of the recommended goal (12% of the recommended 15%).</item>

<title>Journal Entries to Report Employee Compensation and Deductions</title>
<para id="fs-idm334672880">We continue to use Sierra Sports as our example company to prepare journal entries.</para>
<para id="fs-idm483924016">Sierra Sports employs several people, but our focus is on one specific employee for this example. Billie Sanders works for Sierra Sports and earns a salary each month of $2,000. She claims two withholdings allowances (see <link target-id="OSX_Acct_F12_05_TaxTable"/>). This amount is paid on the first of the following month. Withholdings for federal and state income taxes are assessed in the amount of $102 and $25, respectively. FICA Social Security is taxed at the 6.2% rate, and FICA Medicare is taxed at the 1.45% rate. Billie has voluntary deductions for health insurance and a 401(k) retirement contribution. She is responsible for 40% of her $500 health-care insurance premium; Sierra Sports pays the remaining 60% (as explained in employer payroll). The 401(k) contributions total $150. The first entry records the salaries liability during the month of August.</para>

<para id="fs-idm312975456">Salaries Expense is an equity account used to recognize the accumulated (accrued) expense to the business during August (increase on the debit side). Salaries Expense represents the employee’s gross income (pay) before any deductions. Each deduction liability is listed in its own account; this will help for ease of payment to the different entities. Note that Health Insurance Payable is in the amount of $200, which is 40% of the employee’s responsibility for the premium ($500 × 0.40 = $200). Salaries Payable represents net income (pay) or the “take-home pay” for Billie. Salaries Payable is $1,370, which is found by taking gross income and subtracting the sum of the liabilities ($2,000 – $630 = $1,370). Since salaries are not paid until the first of the following month, this liability will remain during the month of August. All liabilities (payables) increase due to the company’s outstanding debt (increase on the credit side).</para>

<para id="fs-idm299458320">Paid sick leave, paid maternity/paternity leave, and vacation compensation help employees take time off when needed or required by providing a stipend while the employee is away. This compensation is often comparable to the wages or salary for the covered period. Some companies have policies that require vacation and paid sick leave to be used within the year or the employee risks losing that benefit in the current period. These benefits are considered estimated liabilities since it is not clear when, if, or how much the employee will use them.

The amounts of Social Security ($124) and Medicare ($29) taxes withheld match the amounts withheld from employee payroll. Federal Unemployment Tax Payable and State Unemployment Tax Payable recognize the liabilities for federal and state unemployment deductions, respectively.
