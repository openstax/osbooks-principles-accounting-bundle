<para id="fs-idm355653984">When we introduced debits and credits, you learned about the usefulness of T-accounts as a graphic representation of any account in the general ledger. But before transactions are posted to the T-accounts, they are first recorded using special forms known as <emphasis effect="italics">journals</emphasis>.</para>

<title>Journals</title>
<para id="fs-idm394796624">Accountants use special forms called <emphasis effect="italics">journals</emphasis> to keep track of their business transactions. A journal is the first place information is entered into the accounting system. A journal is often referred to as the <term id="term-00001">book of original entry</term> because it is the place the information originally enters into the system. A journal keeps a historical account of all recordable transactions with which the company has engaged. In other words, a journal is similar to a diary for a business. When you enter information into a journal, we say you are <term id="term-00002">journalizing</term> the entry. Journaling the entry is the second step in the accounting cycle. Here is a picture of a journal.</para>

<para id="fs-idm396017136">You can see that a journal has columns labeled debit and credit. The debit is on the left side, and the credit is on the right. Let’s look at how we use a journal.</para>

<title>Colfax Market</title>
<para id="fs-idm383672848"><emphasis class="colored-text">Colfax Market</emphasis> is a small corner grocery store that carries a variety of staple items such as meat, milk, eggs, bread, and so on. As a smaller grocery store, <emphasis class="colored-text">Colfax</emphasis> does not offer the variety of products found in a larger supermarket or chain. However, it records journal entries in a similar way.</para>
<para id="fs-idm415962864">Grocery stores of all sizes must purchase product and track inventory. While the number of entries might differ, the recording process does not. For example, <emphasis class="colored-text">Colfax</emphasis> might purchase food items in one large quantity at the beginning of each month, payable by the end of the month. Therefore, it might only have a few accounts payable and inventory journal entries each month. Larger grocery chains might have multiple deliveries a week, and multiple entries for purchases from a variety of vendors on their accounts payable weekly.</para>
<para id="fs-idm360593328">This similarity extends to other retailers, from clothing stores to sporting goods to hardware. No matter the size of a company and no matter the product a company sells, the fundamental accounting entries remain the same.</para>

<title>Posting to the General Ledger</title>
<para id="fs-idm395858768">Recall that the general ledger is a record of each account and its balance. Reviewing journal entries individually can be tedious and time consuming. The general ledger is helpful in that a company can easily extract account and balance information. Here is a small section of a general ledger.</para>
<media id="fs-idm395519600" alt="A General Ledger titled “Cash Account No. 101” with four columns labeled from left to right: Date, Description, Reference, Debit, Credit, Balance. Date 2019. Remaining columns are blank.">

</media>
<para id="fs-idm408950160">You can see at the top is the name of the account “Cash,” as well as the assigned account number “101.” Remember, all asset accounts will start with the number 1. The date of each transaction related to this account is included, a possible description of the transaction, and a reference number if available. There are debit and credit columns, storing the financial figures for each transaction, and a balance column that keeps a running total of the balance in the account after every transaction.</para>
<para id="fs-idm388960608">Let’s look at one of the journal entries from Printing Plus and fill in the corresponding ledgers.</para>
<media id="fs-idm372728000" alt="A journal entry dated January 3, 2019. Debit Cash., 20,000. Credit Common Stock, 20,000. Explanation: Received cash in exchange for common stock.

Balance; 20,000. Below is a General Ledger titled “Common Stock Account No. 301”. Date; 2019, January 3. Description; Cash for common stock. Credit; 20,000. Balance; 20,000.">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/OSX_Acct_F03_05_JornLedg01_img.jpg"/>
</media>
<para id="fs-idm393814000">As you can see, there is one ledger account for Cash and another for Common Stock. Cash is labeled account number 101 because it is an asset account type. The date of January 3, 2019, is in the far left column, and a description of the transaction follows in the next column. Cash had a debit of $20,000 in the journal entry, so $20,000 is transferred to the general ledger in the debit column. The balance in this account is currently $20,000, because no other transactions have affected this account yet.</para>
<para id="fs-idm389764464">Common Stock has the same date and description. Common Stock had a credit of $20,000 in the journal entry, and that information is transferred to the general ledger account in the credit column. The balance at that time in the Common Stock ledger account is $20,000.</para>
<para id="fs-idm394116528">Another key element to understanding the general ledger, and the third step in the accounting cycle, is how to calculate balances in ledger accounts.</para>

<title>Calculating Account Balances</title>
<para id="fs-idm395816208">When calculating balances in ledger accounts, one must take into consideration which side of the account increases and which side decreases. To find the account balance, you must find the difference between the sum of all figures on the side that increases and the sum of all figures on the side that decreases.</para>
<para id="fs-idm353381152">For example, the Cash account is an asset. We know from the accounting equation that assets increase on the debit side and decrease on the credit side. If there was a debit of $5,000 and a credit of $3,000 in the Cash account, we would find the difference between the two, which is $2,000 (5,000 – 3,000). The debit is the larger of the two sides ($5,000 on the debit side as opposed to $3,000 on the credit side), so the Cash account has a debit balance of $2,000.</para>
<para id="fs-idm399606480">Another example is a liability account, such as Accounts Payable, which increases on the credit side and decreases on the debit side. If there were a $4,000 credit and a $2,500 debit, the difference between the two is $1,500. The credit is the larger of the two sides ($4,000 on the credit side as opposed to $2,500 on the debit side), so the Accounts Payable account has a credit balance of $1,500.</para>
<para id="fs-idm622665600">The following are selected journal entries from Printing Plus that affect the Cash account. We will use the Cash ledger account to calculate account balances.</para>

<para id="fs-idm417993248">In the last column of the Cash ledger account is the running balance. This shows where the account stands after each transaction, as well as the final balance in the account. How do we know on which side, debit or credit, to input each of these balances? Let’s consider the general ledger for Cash.</para>
<para id="fs-idm395070976">On January 3, there was a debit balance of $20,000 in the Cash account. On January 9, a debit of $4,000 was included. Since both are on the debit side, they will be added together to get a balance on $24,000 (as is seen in the balance column on the January 9 row). On January 12, there was a credit of $300 included in the Cash ledger account. Since this figure is on the credit side, this $300 is subtracted from the previous balance of $24,000 to get a new balance of $23,700. The same process occurs for the rest of the entries in the ledger and their balances. The final balance in the account is $24,800.</para>
<para id="fs-idm673957248">Checking to make sure the final balance figure is correct; one can review the figures in the debit and credit columns. In the debit column for this cash account, we see that the total is $32,300 (20,000 + 4,000 + 2,800 + 5,500). The credit column totals $7,500 (300 + 100 + 3,500 + 3,600). The difference between the debit and credit totals is $24,800 (32,300 – 7,500). The balance in this Cash account is a debit of $24,800. Having a debit balance in the Cash account is the normal balance for that account.</para>

<title>Posting to the T-Accounts</title>
<para id="fs-idm390177952">The third step in the accounting cycle is to post journal information to the ledger. To do this we can use a T-account format. A company will take information from its journal and post to this general ledger. Posting refers to the process of transferring data from the journal to the general ledger. It is important to understand that T-accounts are only used for illustrative purposes in a textbook, classroom, or business discussion. They are not official accounting forms. Companies will use ledgers for their official books, not T-accounts.</para>

<para id="fs-idm395129440">The sum on the assets side of the accounting equation equals $30,000, found by adding together the final balances in each asset account (24,800 + 1,200 + 500 + 3,500). To find the total on the liabilities and equity side of the equation, we need to find the difference between debits and credits. Credits on the liabilities and equity side of the equation total $34,000 (500 + 4,000 + 20,000 + 9,500). Debits on the liabilities and equity side of the equation total $4,000 (100 + 3,600 + 300). The difference $34,000 – $4,000 = $30,000. Thus, the equation remains balanced with $30,000 on the asset side and $30,000 on the liabilities and equity side. Now that we have the T-account information, and have confirmed the accounting equation remains balanced, we can create the unadjusted trial balance.</para>
