<title>Determination and Evaluation of Overhead Variance</title>
<para id="fs-idm348328800">In a standard cost system, overhead is applied to the goods based on a standard overhead rate. This is similar to the predetermined overhead rate used previously. The standard overhead rate is calculated by dividing budgeted overhead at a given level of production (known as normal capacity) by the level of activity required for that particular level of production.</para>

<title>Creation of Flexible Overhead Budget</title>
<para id="fs-idm350935808">To determine the overhead standard cost, companies prepare a <term>flexible budget</term> that gives estimated revenues and costs at varying levels of production. The standard overhead cost is usually expressed as the sum of its component parts, fixed and variable costs per unit. Note that at different levels of production, total fixed costs are the same, so the standard fixed cost per unit will change for each production level. However, the variable standard cost per unit is the same per unit for each level of production, but the total variable costs will change.</para>
<para id="fs-idm356469680">We continue to use Connie’s Candy Company to illustrate. Suppose Connie’s Candy budgets capacity of production at 100% and determines expected overhead at this capacity. Connie’s Candy also wants to understand what overhead cost outcomes will be at 90% capacity and 110% capacity. The following information is the flexible budget Connie’s Candy prepared to show expected overhead at each capacity level.</para>
<media id="fs-idm348370832" class="scaled-down" alt="Percent of capacity: 90 percent, 100 percent, 110 percent respectively. Direct labor hours 1,800, 2,000, 2,200. Units of output 900, 1,000, 1,100. Variable overhead $3,600, 4,000, 4,400. Fixed overhead $6,000, 6,000, 6,000. Total overhead $9,600, 10,000, 10,400. Normal capacity equals 100 percent and overhead is applied based on direct labor hours. Standard Overhead Rate equals $10,000 divided by 2,000 equals $5 per direct labor hour.">

<para id="fs-idm294595696">Units of output at 100% is 1,000 candy boxes (units). The standard overhead rate is the total budgeted overhead of $10,000 divided by the level of activity (direct labor hours) of 2,000 hours. Notice that fixed overhead remains constant at each of the production levels, but variable overhead changes based on unit output. If Connie’s Candy only produced at 90% capacity, for example, they should expect total overhead to be $9,600 and a standard overhead rate of $5.33 (rounded). If Connie’s Candy produced 2,200 units, they should expect total overhead to be $10,400 and a standard overhead rate of $4.73 (rounded). In addition to the total standard overhead rate, Connie’s Candy will want to know the variable overhead rates at each activity level.</para>
<para id="fs-idm342663616">Using the flexible budget, we can determine the standard variable cost per unit at each level of production by taking the total expected variable overhead divided by the level of activity, which can still be direct labor hours or machine hours.</para>

<title>Determination of Variable Overhead Variances</title>
<para id="fs-idm628814256">There are two components to variable overhead rates: the overhead application rate and the activity level against which that rate was applied. If we compare the actual variable overhead to the standard variable overhead, by analyzing the difference between actual overhead costs and the standard overhead for current production, it is difficult to determine if the variance is due to application rate differences or activity level differences. Thus, there are two variable overhead variances that will better provide these answers: the variable overhead rate variance and the variable overhead efficiency variance.</para>

<title>Purchasing Planes</title>
<para id="fs-idm306793824">The XYZ Firm is bidding on a contract for a new plane for the military. As the management team is going over the bid, they come to the conclusion it is too high on a per-plane basis, but they cannot find any costs they feel can be reduced. The information from the military states they will purchase between 50 and 100 planes, but will more likely purchase 50 planes rather than 100 planes. XYZ’s bid is based on 50 planes. The controller suggests that they base their bid on 100 planes. This would spread the fixed costs over more planes and reduce the bid price. The lower bid price will increase substantially the chances of XYZ winning the bid. Should XYZ Firm keep the bid at 50 planes or increase its bid to 100 planes? What are the pros and cons to keeping the bid at 50 or increasing to 100 planes?</para>

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<list id="fs-idm623269360" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>There are two sets of overhead variances: variable and fixed.</item>
<item>The variable variances are caused by the overhead application rate and the activity level against which the rate was applied.</item>
<item>The variable overhead rate variance is the difference between the actual variable manufacturing overhead and the variable overhead that was expected given the number of hours worked.</item>
<item>The variable overhead efficiency variance is driven by the difference between the actual hours worked and the standard hours expected for the units produced.</item>
<item>There are two fixed overhead variances. One is caused by spending too much or too little on fixed overhead. The other is caused by actual production being above or below the expected production level.</item>
