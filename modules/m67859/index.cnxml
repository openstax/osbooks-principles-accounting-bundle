<para id="fs-idm627324592">We next take a look at a comprehensive example that works through the entire accounting cycle for Clip’em Cliff. Clifford Girard retired from the US Marine Corps after 20 years of active duty. Cliff decides it would be fun to become a barber and open his own shop called “Clip’em Cliff.” He will run the barber shop out of his home for the first couple of months while he identifies a new location for his shop.</para>
<para id="fs-idm360240096">Since his Marines career included several years of logistics, he is also going to operate a consulting practice where he will help budding barbers create a barbering practice. He will charge a flat fee or a per hour charge. His consulting practice will be recognized as service revenue and will provide additional revenue while he develops his barbering practice.</para>
<para id="fs-idm364527584">He obtains a barber’s license after the required training and is ready to open his shop on August 1. <link target-id="fs-idm365857120"/> shows his transactions from the first month of business.</para>

<para id="fs-idm366902496">Once all journal entries have been created, the next step in the accounting cycle is to post journal information to the ledger. The ledger is visually represented by T-accounts. Cliff will go through each transaction and transfer the account information into the debit or credit side of that ledger account. Any account that has more than one transaction needs to have a final balance calculated. This happens by taking the difference between the debits and credits in an account.</para>

<title>Reversing Entries</title>
<para id="fs-idm363747104">One step in the accounting cycle that we did not cover is reversing entries. Reversing entries can be made at the beginning of a new period to certain accruals. The company will reverse adjusting entries made in the prior period to the revenue and expense accruals.</para>

<title>Using Liquidity Ratios to Evaluate Financial Performance</title>
<para id="fs-idm353928112">You own a landscaping business that has just begun operations. You made several expensive equipment purchases in your first month to get your business started. These purchases very much reduced your cash-on-hand, and in turn your liquidity suffered in the following months with a low working capital and current ratio.</para>
<para id="fs-idm362405456">Your business is now in its eighth month of operation, and while you are starting to see a growth in sales, you are not seeing a significant change in your working capital or current ratio from the low numbers in your early months. What could you attribute to this stagnancy in liquidity? Is there anything you can do as a business owner to better these liquidity measurements? What will happen if you cannot change your liquidity or it gets worse?</para>
