<para id="fs-idm432222016">In <link document="m67947">Building Blocks of Managerial Accounting</link>, you learned how to determine and recognize the fixed and variable components of costs, and now you have learned about contribution margin. Those concepts can be used together to conduct <term class="no-emphasis">cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis</term>, which is a method used by companies to determine what will occur financially if selling prices change, costs (either fixed or variable) change, or sales/production volume changes.</para>
<para id="fs-idm469920800">It is important, first, to make several assumptions about operations in order to understand CVP analysis and the associated contribution margin income statement. However, while the following assumptions are typical in CVP analysis, there can be exceptions. For example, while we typically assume that the sales price will remain the same, there might be exceptions where a quantity discount might be allowed. Our CVP analysis will be based on these assumptions:</para>
<list id="fs-idm453386464" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>Costs are linear and can clearly be designated as either fixed or variable. In other words, fixed costs remain fixed in total over the relevant range and variable costs remain fixed on a per-unit basis. For example, if a company has the capability of producing up to 1,000 units a month of a product given its current resources, the relevant range would be 0 to 1,000. If they decided that they wanted to produce 1,800 units a month, they would have to secure additional production capacity. While they might be able to add an extra production shift and then produce 1,800 units a month without buying an additional machine that would increase production capacity to 2,000 units a month, companies often have to buy additional production equipment to increase their relevant range. In this example, the production capacity between 1,800 and 2,000 would be an expense that currently would not provide additional contribution toward fixed costs.</item>
<item>Selling price per unit remains constant and does not increase or decrease based on volume (i.e., customers are not given discounts based on quantity purchased).</item>
<item>In the case of manufacturing businesses, inventory does not change because we make the assumption that all units produced are sold.</item>
<item>In the case of a company that sells multiple products, the sales mix remains constant. For example, if we are a beverage supplier, we might assume that our beverage sales are 3 units of coffee pods and two units of tea bags.</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm161762544">Using these assumptions, we can begin our discussion of CVP analysis with the break-even point.</para>

<title>Basics of the Break-Even Point</title>
<para id="fs-idm440067520">The <term>break-even point</term> is the dollar amount (total sales dollars) or production level (total units produced) at which the company has recovered all variable and fixed costs. In other words, no profit or loss occurs at break-even because Total Cost = Total Revenue. <link target-id="OSX_Acct_M03_02_BrkEvn"/> illustrates the components of the break-even point:</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm170059840">The basic theory illustrated in <link target-id="OSX_Acct_M03_02_BrkEvn"/> is that, because of the existence of fixed costs in most production processes, in the first stages of production and subsequent sale of the products, the company will realize a loss. For example, assume that in an extreme case the company has fixed costs of $20,000, a sales price of $400 per unit and variable costs of $250 per unit, and it sells no units. It would realize a loss of $20,000 (the fixed costs) since it recognized no revenue or variable costs. This loss explains why the company’s cost graph recognized costs (in this example, $20,000) even though there were no sales. If it subsequently sells units, the loss would be reduced by $150 (the contribution margin) for each unit sold. This relationship will be continued until we reach the break-even point, where total revenue equals total costs. Once we reach the break-even point for each unit sold the company will realize an increase in profits of $150.</para>
<para id="fs-idm213603744">For each additional unit sold, the loss typically is lessened until it reaches the break-even point. At this stage, the company is theoretically realizing neither a profit nor a loss. After the next sale beyond the break-even point, the company will begin to make a profit, and the profit will continue to increase as more units are sold. While there are exceptions and complications that could be incorporated, these are the general guidelines for break-even analysis.</para>
<para id="fs-idm208684768">As you can imagine, the concept of the break-even point applies to every business endeavor—manufacturing, retail, and service. Because of its universal applicability, it is a critical concept to managers, business owners, and accountants. When a company first starts out, it is important for the owners to know when their sales will be sufficient to cover all of their fixed costs and begin to generate a profit for the business. Larger companies may look at the break-even point when investing in new machinery, plants, or equipment in order to predict how long it will take for their sales volume to cover new or additional fixed costs. Since the break-even point represents that point where the company is neither losing nor making money, managers need to make decisions that will help the company reach and <emphasis effect="italics">exceed</emphasis> this point as quickly as possible. No business can operate for very long below break-even. Eventually the company will suffer losses so great that they are forced to close their doors.</para>

<title>Break-Even Analysis and Profitability</title>
<para id="fs-idm174167440">The first step in determining the viability of the business decision to sell a product or provide a service is analyzing the true cost of the product or service and the timeline of payment for the product or service. Ethical managers need an estimate of a product or service's cost and related revenue streams to evaluate the chance of reaching the break-even point.</para>
<para id="fs-idm210609472">Determining an accurate price for a product or service requires a detailed analysis of both the cost and how the cost changes as the volume increases. This analysis includes the timing of both costs and receipts for payment, as well as how these costs will be financed. An example is an IT service contract for a corporation where the costs will be frontloaded. When costs or activities are frontloaded, a greater proportion of the costs or activities occur in an earlier stage of the project. An IT service contract is typically employee cost intensive and requires an estimate of at least 120 days of employee costs before a payment will be received for the costs incurred. An IT service contract for $100,000 in monthly services with a 30% profit margin will require 4 months of upfront financing of $280,000 balanced over the four months before a single payment is received.</para>
<para id="fs-idm758190416">The overall profit at a specific point in time requires a careful determination of all of the costs associated with creating and selling the product or providing the service. An ethical managerial accountant will provide a realistic cost estimate, regardless of management's desire to sell a product or provide a service. What might be a lucrative product on its face needs additional analysis provided by the managerial accountant.</para>

<para id="fs-idm464859808">Hicks Manufacturing is interested in finding out the point at which they break even selling their Blue Jay Model birdbath. They will break even when the operating income is $0. The operating income is determined by subtracting the total variable and fixed costs from the sales revenue generated by an enterprise. In other words, the managers at Hicks want to know how many Blue Jay birdbaths they will need to sell in order to cover their fixed expenses and break even. Information on this product is:</para>

<title>Examples of the Effects of Variable and Fixed Costs in Determining the Break-Even Point</title>
<para id="fs-idm493991664">Companies typically do not want to simply break even, as they are in business to make a profit. Break-even analysis also can help companies determine the level of sales (in dollars or in units) that is needed to make a desired profit. The process for factoring a desired level of profit into a break-even analysis is to add the desired level of profit to the fixed costs and then calculate a new break-even point. We know that Hicks Manufacturing breaks even at 225 Blue Jay birdbaths, but what if they have a target profit for the month of July? They can simply add that target to their fixed costs. By calculating a target profit, they will produce and (hopefully) sell enough bird baths to cover both fixed costs and the target profit.</para>

<para id="fs-idm203795280">The tax rate indicates the amount of tax expense that will result from any profits and 1 – tax rate indicates the amount remaining after taking out tax expense. The concept is similar to buying an item on sale. If an item costs $80 and is on sale for 40% off, then the amount being paid for the item is 60% of the sale price, or $48 ($80 × 60%). Another way to find this involves two steps. First find the discount ($80 × 40% = $32) and then subtract the discount from the sales price ($80 – $32 = $48).</para>
<para id="fs-idm217678720">Taxes and profit work in a similar fashion. If we know the profit before tax is $100,000 and the tax rate is 30%, then tax expenses are $100,000 × 30% = $30,000. This means the after-tax income is $100,000 – $30,000 = $70,000. However, in most break-even situations, as well as other decision-making areas, the desired after-tax profit is known, and the pre-tax profit must be determined by dividing the after-tax profit by 1 – tax rate.</para>

<title>Application of Break-Even Concepts for a Service Organization</title>
<para id="fs-idm221118512">Because break-even analysis is applicable to any business enterprise, we can apply these same principles to a service organization. For example, Marshall &amp; Hirito is a mid-sized accounting firm that provides a wide range of accounting services to its clients but relies heavily on personal income tax preparation for much of its revenue. They have analyzed the cost to the firm associated with preparing these returns. They have determined the following cost structure for the preparation of a standard 1040A Individual Income Tax Return:</para>

<para id="fs-idm201001728">Note that in either scenario, the break-even point is the same in dollars and units, regardless of approach. Thus, you can always find the break-even point (or a desired profit) in units and then convert it to sales by multiplying by the selling price per unit.

He is to prepare a presentation to you and your partners outlining his strategy for taking the company into this expanded market.
